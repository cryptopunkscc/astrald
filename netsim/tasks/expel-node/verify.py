"""verify expel-node: node1 (the User) permanently banned node2 from the swarm.

Independent check (does not trust run.sh). Asserts node2 is recorded in
user.list_expelled and is gone from node1's user.swarm_status roster
(user.OpSwarmStatus -> ActiveNodes filters the expelledSet). Link state is not
asserted.

node2's identity comes from node1's siblings.json (recorded by adopt-node), NOT
from node2 itself: once expelled, node2 rejects user.info (query rejected (2)
untokened, auth_failed with the User token -- it no longer accepts the User it
was banned from), so it is not a usable identity source.

Queries reach node1's apphost through the shared astral-py client
(tasks/_lib/astralapi.py), CLI fallback for anything it can't serve.
