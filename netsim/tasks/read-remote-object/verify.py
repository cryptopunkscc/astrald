"""verify read-remote-object: node1 read the peer's object over astral.

object-store --target node2 put the object on the peer (node2) and recorded
object_id in node1's object.json (the bytes are the fixed payload.txt it shipped
to node1); read-remote-object's agent (on node1, as the User) read it back from
the peer and recorded object_remote in read.json.

Independent host-side check: re-read the peer's object AS THE USER (node1 holds
the token) via <peer>:objects.load and assert the bytes equal the stored payload
-- this is the authenticated, routable direction. Also cross-checks the agent's
recorded read.

Queries reach node1's apphost through the shared astral-py client
(tasks/_lib/netsim_astral.py), CLI fallback for anything it can't serve.
