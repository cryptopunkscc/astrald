# Concept Notes

Concept files are compact cross-module notes. They define shared vocabulary, mental models, invariants, and boundaries that module guides assume.

Use a concept file when the idea spans modules, such as identity, queries, links, wire encoding, objects, zones, or auth. Use a module guide when the note is mostly about one module's source files.

## Style

- Start with `# Name`.
- Add a short opening paragraph only when it clarifies the concept.
- Use concrete headings named after the concept's parts, not a fixed template.
- Prefer bullets for facts, invariants, and rules.
- Use small tables only for compact vocabularies or mappings.
- Keep prose sparse and source-grounded.
- Link or name modules only when ownership matters.

## Content

Good concept notes usually answer:

- What is this thing?
- What are its core types, states, or roles?
- What invariants must not be broken?
- How does it cross module boundaries?
- What nearby concept or module should be read next?

Avoid tutorials, long API inventories, file listings, and module-specific implementation detail.
