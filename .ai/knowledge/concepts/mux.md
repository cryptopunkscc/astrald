# Session Multiplexer

## Model

A **Link** is the physical carrier: one brontide-encrypted connection over one transport
(`tcp`, `kcp`, `tor`, `gw`). Establishment is expensive: Noise XK handshake, possible NAT
traversal, possible Tor circuit.

A **Session** is a logical pipe over a Link: one routed Query, tracked by a 64-bit
`Nonce`, with independent read/write buffers and flow control. Sessions are cheap; one
Link can carry many.

The `Mux` is a layer attached to each Link. It shares the Link's
`channel.Channel`, encodes outbound `frames.Frame` objects through it, and
dispatches inbound objects via `Mux.Handle`.

```
Session (logical, many)
  └─ Mux (frames over the Link's channel)
       └─ Link (channel.Channel, locked writes, brontide transport)
```

Opening many services to the same peer uses one brontide handshake, not one per
session.

## Multiplexing Invariants

- **Cost**: reuse one Link per identity to amortize handshake, NAT hole-punch, and Tor
  setup cost.
- **Symmetry**: after Link establishment, both peers use the Mux identically.
  Either side may send a `Query` or `RelayQuery` frame.
- **Isolation**: `Nonce` identifies the session. Flow control, buffer state, and
  close/reset are per-session, so one slow reader does not block unrelated sessions.
- **Router gate**: `Mux.SetRouter` is one-shot; inbound queries block in
  `waitRouter` until `LinkPool.AddLink` wires the node router.

## Flow control

Each session has independent credit, expressed by `OutputBuffer.wsize`.

- Sender's `OutputBuffer.Write` consumes `wsize` and dispatches via the per-session
  send callback, which chunks at `maxPayloadSize` (8 KB) and emits `Data` frames.
- When `wsize == 0`, `Write` returns `ErrBufferEmpty` and `muxSessionWriter` waits on
  the buffer's wake channel.
- Receiver's `muxSessionReader` drains the `InputBuffer`; each `Read` triggers the
  per-session `onRead` callback that sends a `Read` frame granting that many bytes.
- `defaultBufferSize` is 4 MB.

A blocked session does not stall other sessions on the same Link: each session has
its own buffers and the link's channel mutex only serialises one frame send at a
time.

## Session migration

A session can migrate from one Link to another Link while it remains open and
in-flight. The current Link's pressure detector decides when to upgrade.

Upgrade selection (`connectivityUpgrade`):

1. Prefer any existing sibling Link to the same peer with no pressure detector or no
   active pressure.
2. Otherwise force a new Link with `StrategyNAT` and `WithForceNew()`.

Eligible sessions are then migrated; a session is eligible at age >= 30 s or bytes
>= 1 MB.

### Preserved State

- Session `Nonce`; the application-level pipe identity does not change.
- Already-buffered unread data in the old `InputBuffer`; the reader continues to
  drain it before switching to the next buffer.
- Query string, peer identities, and the cumulative `bytes` counter.

### Replaced State

- `muxSessionReader.buf` swaps to a new `InputBuffer` after the old one drains;
  `SetNextBuffer` queues it and `Advance` closes the current one.
- `muxSessionWriter.buf` swaps via `SwapBuf` to a new `OutputBuffer` bound to the
  new link's send callback; writes pause until `Resume`.
- The session moves between mux session maps when the link changes
  (`oldMux.removeSession` then `newMux.addSession`).

## Migration Protocol

Migration is signalled over a separate `nodes.migrate_session` query channel using
`MigrateSignal` objects, while `frames.Migrate` runs on each link's mux to delimit
the data hand-off. Both peers send a `Migrate` frame.

Initiator (`migrateSession`):

1. Open `nodes.migrate_session` to the peer with the target `LinkID`.
2. `migrator.Begin(target)`: CAS `stateOpen -> stateMigrating`, pause the writer,
   swap its buffer to the new link, and queue the new `InputBuffer` as
   `nextBuffer`.
3. Send `MigrateSignalReady` with the local buffer size.
4. Wait for `MigrateSignalSwitched` and record the peer buffer.
5. Send a `Migrate` frame on the old link; this tells the peer all old-link data
   has been emitted.
6. `WaitClosed`: block until the old `InputBuffer` is closed (the peer's
   `handleMigrate` calls `reader.Advance` which closes it once empty).
7. Send `MigrateSignalResume`, then wait for `MigrateSignalDone`.
8. `migrator.Complete`: move the session between mux maps, `stateMigrating ->
   stateOpen`, grow writer credit to the peer buffer, resume the writer.

Responder (`OpMigrateSession`):

1. Receive `MigrateSignalReady`, call `migrator.Begin`.
2. Send a `Migrate` frame on the old link.
3. Send `MigrateSignalSwitched` with the local buffer size.
4. `WaitClosed`, then receive `MigrateSignalResume`.
5. `migrator.Complete`, then send `MigrateSignalDone`.

The session stays open. The application-facing `io.ReadWriter` keeps working over
the new carrier.

`migrateSessionTimeout` (30 s) caps each migration; auto-migrations also fail if
the session is not yet eligible.
