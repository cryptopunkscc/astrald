# Warp Drive

Decentralized application for private and secured file sharing.

## Vision

We believe:

1. Digital data sharing is one of the most crucial parts of the internet communication.
2. Humans have equal rights to protect their privacy and free speech.
3. Trusted and secure product must also be transparent and verifiable for anyone interested.
4. Physical limitations cannot be applied to virtual world where digital data can be copied infinity amount of times.
5. Decentralisation is the way to protect ourselves in virtual environment. Centralized attacks are ineffective in a
   decentralized environment.
6. Reinventing the wheel is a waste of time. End-user products should be focused only on solving end-user problems
   delegating non-business issues like connectivity to other instances designed for solving specialized technical
   problems.

## Mission

Provide free and simple solution for secure and private data sharing across the popular platforms.

## Target

Anyone who:

* Needs to share the data
* Expects simplicity, security and privacy.
* Can use communication oriented electronic devices, like smartphones, personal computers or any other devices capable
  to run desired software.
* Don't want to rely on closed source or paid solutions.

## Goals

* Support all popular platforms like: Linux, Android, iOS, Windows, macOS.
* Provide solution intuitive for non-technical users, but familiar with digital devices.
* Implement task oriented interface, designed to achieve expected results in the shortest possible way.
* Create the product highly reliable in unfavorable environment, that allows to initiate a connection between devices
  and transfer the data in any possible way.
