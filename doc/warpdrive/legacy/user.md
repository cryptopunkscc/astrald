# Story

I can share files with my mates.

# Scenarios

### Case 1

Person familiar with modern mobile and PC applications, who facing the problems with insufficient connectivity, privacy
or security during files sharing in various situations.

#### Scenario:

Bogdan is a photo and video maker, and he likes to share his art with a friends. Bogdan is using iPhone every day but a
lot of his friends owns Android smartphones. He is using official application for sharing files to mates with Apple
devices, but for others he is choosing multiplatform messengers. Bogdan is aware how the privacy and security are
important today. He thought that applications that he uses are fully secured by end-to-end encryption but unfortunately
that is not true for some cases. Bogdan parties a lot, sometimes in underground places where WI-FI or mobile connection
is not accessible. He already faced the issues with poor device connectivity in places like that, especially across
different mobile platforms.

#### Summary:

Bogdan would like to have one simple and secure application for sending files across mobile and PC devices used by his
friends. Would be awesome if application will work without Wi-Fi or mobile connection or even fully offline. The
interface should require a minimum of focus to not be distracting during other activities like conversation.

### Case 2

Person without technical knowledge. Uses PC and smartphone mainly for web browsing and communication. Is not aware
advanced features of modern devices.

#### Scenario:

Kinga has an Android smartphone. She knows how to use modern apps, but she still prefers MMS for sending photos. She is
not satisfied how MMS downscales images quality, but she doesn't want to use social apps or fancy messengers and care
about virtual accounts. She confirmed that doesn't care about security and privacy when communicating with friends, but
she doesn't think the email is the best choice for sending private documents that should be secured.

#### Summary:

Kinga prefers simple and single task oriented solutions. She is open for the new option only if the benefits are free of
additional cost in form of complexity and unnecessary engagement.
